Multicast Network Data Structures Final Project ðŸ›œ
-------------------------------------------------------
Project separated into 2 assignments please refer to the project PDF for more description.
Here, an MST algorithm was used to implement the project. Specifically, Prim's Algorithm to construct an MST.

In the second assignment, a modified Prim's Algorithm was deployed in an attempt to solve a problem that is designed to be a Steiner Tree Problem.
